## Functions and Features

### Pixel-Perfect and Fully Mobile Responsive User Interfaces:
I have meticulously crafted pixel-perfect user interfaces that seamlessly adapt to various screen sizes. The design mirrors the precision of the original Figma layout.

- **Chart.js Implementation:** I leveraged Chart.js to bring dynamic and visually appealing barcharts and donut charts to our dashboard. The charts faithfully replicate the visual elements present in the Figma design.

- **Hamburger Button for Customized Mobile Sidebar:** To optimize the user experience on mobile devices, I implemented a "Hamburger" button, allowing users to access a customized sidebar that remains hidden in smaller screen resolutions.

### Customized Datatable and Pagination:
Our datatable and pagination components have undergone extensive customization to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience. The design prioritizes clarity and efficiency in presenting tabular data.

### Single JSON Fake Data for Dashboard:
In the dashboard section, I have streamlined data integration by utilizing a single JSON fake data source. This approach enhances convenience and lays a foundation for easy integration with GraphQL APIs in the future.

### Reusable Component Library:
Throughout the development process, I have invested in creating a library of reusable components. This not only promotes code consistency but also facilitates efficient development and maintenance cycles.
